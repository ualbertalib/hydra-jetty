# hydra-jetty

This is a copy of jetty with the needed applications for running Hydra.  These include two java-based applications:

* [Fedora repository](https://github.com/futures/fcrepo4)
* [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)

## Included Versions

* jetty: 8.1.16
* solr: 4.10.2
* fedora: 3.8

## Usage

### Dependencies

* [Java 7 (JRE)](https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp)

#### Java 6

Java 6 is unsupported under Solr 4.9, but still supported under Fedora 3.7.1.  However, hydra-jetty has only been tested under
Java 7 so it is recommended to use Java 7 and not Java 6.

### Manual
  
    git clone https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-jetty
    cd hydra-jetty
    java -Xmx256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -jar start.jar

You can also change the port jetty starts on by editing the file etc/jetty.xml and changing this line to indicate a different port number:

    <Set name="port"><SystemProperty name="jetty.port" default="8983"/></Set>

### Using jettywrapper

For use within your Hydra application's Rails directory.

    rake jetty:install
    rake jetty:start

See [jettywrapper](https://github.com/projecthydra/jettywrapper) for more information regarding configuration and usage.
Port numbers and other java options maybe configured via the gem. 
    
### Interaction

When jetty is finished initializing itself, Solr is available at 

* [http://localhost:8983/solr/](http://localhost:8983/solr/)

Fedora is available in two copies, one for developement

* [http://localhost:8983/fedora/](http://localhost:8983/fedora/)

and an additional copy for testing:

* [http://localhost:8983/fedora-test/](http://localhost:8983/fedora-test/)

You can see a list of all installed applications at

* [http://localhost:8983](http://localhost:8983)

### Updating

#### Solr and Jetty

Solr is updated by downloading the latest from [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/), which includes an instance of Jetty in the
`example` directory.  Updating is a process of replacing the jar files as well as the solr.war and start.jar files.  Note that the
example from Lucene does not include the start.ini file.

## Fedora Migration

Fedora4 is currently available in the `fedora-4/master` branch and can be automatically downloaded and installed via Jettywrapper
using this url:

    https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-jetty/archive/fedora-4/master.zip

If you want to give migration a try, the `fedora-4/migration` branch has both Fedora3 and Fedora4 installed, along with Solr, and is available
via this url:

    https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-jetty/archive/fedora-4/migrate.zip
